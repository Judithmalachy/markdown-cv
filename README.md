## Technical Reflection & Personal Process

This project pushed me through one of the most intense technical learning curves I’ve ever experienced. The task was to create a Markdown-based CV, publish it as a live webpage using GitHub Pages, and reflect on the process — but what seemed like a simple assignment turned into a deeply stressful journey.

###  Technical Work Done

- I initialized a Git repository, committed and tracked changes using the terminal
- Created and worked on a feature branch for the new CV section
- Merged it back into `master` using a Pull Request
- Configured GitHub Pages to serve my Markdown CV as a live website
- Edited files both from the terminal and directly on GitHub to fix or update content
- Dealt with authentication and GitHub Pages setup that didn’t behave as expected

### Challenges I Faced

The process was far from smooth:

- I had **Git authentication issues** that kept blocking my push commands and delayed my progress
- The **GitHub Pages setup was confusing**, especially figuring out which URL was actually hosting my site
- At one point, I had multiple branches and was unsure which one to publish or where my real CV lived
- The terminal sometimes froze or stopped accepting commands, forcing me to cancel and start over
- I spent long hours figuring things out that were supposed to take minutes

### Personal Reflection

I was exhaused, frustrated and even considered giving up multiple times. Despite following instructions, GitHub often didn’t respond the way I expected. I felt stuck, overwhelmed, and mentally drained — but I didn’t give up.

Through persistence and support, I managed to complete every part of the assignment. I now understand Git and GitHub better, not just technically, but also the patience and resilience required to work with real-world tools. This experience reminded me that learning isn’t always smooth, but the growth comes from pushing through the frustration.

This project wasn’t just about publishing a CV. It was about proving to myself that I can stick with something difficult and come out the other side with real, practical skills.
